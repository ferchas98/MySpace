      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms of Use ("<b>Terms</b>") carefully as they govern
        your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services
        for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and
        software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms
        (collectively, the "<b>Spotify Service</b>") and any music, videos,
        podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through
        the Spotify Service ("<b>Content</b>").
      </p>

      <p>
        Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the
        <a href="#">Spotify Privacy Policy</a> and additional terms and
        conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these
        Terms by this reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to
        these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use
        the Spotify Service or access any Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER
        SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY
        OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION
        THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.
